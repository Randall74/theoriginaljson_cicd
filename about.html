                    <p>
                        It all began around 1984. I remember becoming enthralled with computers the very first time I
                        used one of the four Apple IIe's (or //e) at our elementary school's library.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Around the same time, my best friend's parents bought him a Commodore 64 on which we wasted
                        many hours playing video games and learning the basics of, erm... BASIC. We also played around
                        with FORTRAN and Pascal. But, when it comes down to it, we were only scratching the surface of
                        these languages and, all we had to rely upon were manuals that were basically written for
                        someone that actually had a clue. Nevertheless, I would come to realize later on that this was
                        the turning point for me; the time that I had finally figured out what I really wanted to do
                        the rest of my life.
                    </p>

                    </div>

                    <p>
                        But, being a pre-teen, who knew what I actually wanted? I also thought I wanted to be a
                        professional skateboarder, musician, artist, actor, comedian, astronaut, etc.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Later, in high school, when I got online for the first time in my life, using my dad's account,
                        I knew I was hooked. I wanted to know all the inner workings of the Internet and Websites. This
                        was in 1991 and, using CompuServe as the means of connecting to the Internet and the Gopher
                        protocol as the "browser" to scour the online bulletin boards, I found it was actually rather
                        difficult to obtain any sort of information regarding how any of this worked.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I remember when I finally decided I wanted to go to college, I mentioned wanting to go to
                        school for Computer Science. My parents' friend, who was a programmer, told them that I should
                        reconsider because, as he saw it, there was no money to be made with working with computers and
                        that it was fad that would soon die out.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Well, needless to say, this was a devasting, soul-crushing thing to hear. What am I going to do
                        now? I decided to go into the field of Nursing, where I completed many hours of courses before
                        realizing that I just wasn't in love with it. So, I did what any enterprising youngster with
                        large ambitions would do. I joined the Air Force.
                    </p>

                    <div style="width:450px; margin: auto;"><img src="images/photos/Jason USAF.jpg" width="100%" height="350px;"
                            frameBorder="0" />
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        While I certainly don't regret one moment of serving our country, I did realize that I may have
                        been hasty when making this decision. I was, after all, still in love with the idea of all
                        things computer-related.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When I returned home, I worked part-time at a warehouse while I tried to decide what I wanted
                        to do with the rest of my life. I picked up a study guide for advanced firefighting and
                        emergency medical services. In a few short months, I said goodbye to my 3rd shift friends at
                        the mill and began my career as a Firefighter I and continued to cross-train as an EMT and,
                        later, a Paramedic.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It was during one of my "long weekends" that a friend of mine, who had just retired from the
                        Marine Corps, asked if I would like a part-time job working under him for a little-known
                        company called IBM.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I couldn't believe it. Of course, I wanted to do this! So, I began working as a field repair
                        technician during my downtime from the fire department. But, soon, I started to realize that,
                        more than anything, I truly wanted to immerse myself into the world of Information Technology.
                        After another 12 months of working both jobs, I informed my Battalion Officers that I was
                        officially resigning my post at the Headquarters and that I would be focusing on my endeavor to
                        become a full-timer at IBM.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This was definitely one of the hardest decisions I had made in my life, but I knew that it
                        would work out for the best in the long run.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I ended up working a full decade at IBM, starting from a field repair technician, to a Level I
                        Help Desk Rep., to a Level III Remote Network and Systems Lead Technician and, eventually, a
                        Technical Team Lead over 3 groups (Printer Suppport, Desktop Support, and Remote Services
                        [Servers, Databases]).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After leaving IBM, I worked in several various IT roles ranging from Systems Adminstrator,
                        Network Engineer, and Operations Lead. But, my interest was always in software and Web
                        development. I just never really had any opportunities to do anything with this dream of mine
                        in any capacity at the many companies/jobs I worked in.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finally, in 2010, when my wife and I discovered she was pregant with our first child, I
                        launched myself full-time into learning everyting humanly possible about software development.
                        I had no idea where to start, but I knew that if I didn't try something soon, I would continue
                        returning to the same sort of positions that I had been working in for nearly 15 years.
                    </p>

                    <div style="width:450px; margin: auto;"><img src="images/photos/PBR_and_PHP.JPG" width="100%"
                            height="350px;" frameBorder="0" />
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Around this time, I began working as contractor and I was beginning to recieve calls from
                        recruiters about positions in the software field.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Just after our son was born, I received information from the VA that I was elgible for a
                        one-time education benefit that they were launching in the next couple months. I immediately
                        jumped on this opportunity and was soon enrolled in a Web Development Specialist program at my
                        local college. After a year of working full-time, taking a full-load of 13+ hours at school and
                        raising an irascible and precocious little boy, I was finally receiving multiple interviews for
                        Web developer positions at many companies in my area.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Ultimately, I selected CareerBuilder as my choice, mainly because I perused their site many
                        times over the years and always had my own ideas of what I would like to see. But, also because
                        the
                        position I accepted utilized PHP and JavaScript as their main codebase.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In 2014, I interviewed for a Web Developer position at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta and
                        have been happily working on many event sites to this day.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After many years of working in several odd jobs, I have finally landed my dream job and I am
                        truly happy. Even with that being said, I still work on studying and learning new languages,
                        stacks, and libraries on a consistent basis.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Which brings me to end of this long, meandering story. Never give up! Never quit learning.
                    </p>
